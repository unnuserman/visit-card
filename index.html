        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
        <p class="text1"> "Hey, I'm a 16 y/o student who's into web dev — though that's more of a side thing.<br>
          I'm actually studying to be a pastry chef (yeah, I know... kinda random, but whatever).<br>
          I live in Russia, Siberia (nope, not exiled lol), and it's hella cold here. Like, seriously freezing. I hate it.<br>

          Also got a few other hobbies — I read Friedrich Nietzsche (turns out his philosophy isn't really for me; built my own instead. Not gonna push it on anyone, it kinda speaks for itself anyway).<br>
          I'm into shooting nature, and not only.<br>
          Oh, and one more thing about me: I learned HTML/CSS in a single day. JS though? Yeah, that's a bit rough 'cause I'm just too lazy to study it. But I'll 100% get my act together and learn it."</p>

        <div id="targets">
          <h3>TARGETS</h3>
          <p class="text2"><b>"Alright, I've got a bunch of goals lined up, but here are a few:</b><br>
<br>
Learn JS (yeah, it's literally on my list — see? I'm serious lol).<br>
<br>
Get better at talking to my classmates — I've opened up way more lately, so I think I'll actually pull it off.<br>
<br>
Move out of this city... maybe even the country. Nothing against my homeland, but it kinda feels like this place isn't for me. I'm craving space (lmao — space in the world's largest country, go figure). It's like I'm trapped. Or maybe it's just the city. Idk, idk...<br>
<br>
Land a decent job so future me can be happy.<br>
<br>
Plant a tree.<br>
<br>
Get a nice apartment or house.<br>
<br>
And when I'm retired, just do what I love — probably still shooting streets, btw :3"<br></p>

        <h3>WHERE I STAND</h3>
       <p>"I'm completely neutral — in my actions, my views, everything.
        Yeah, I consider myself Russian, but only 'cause I was born here.
        I don't stand for Russia or against anyone else. I'm under a neutral flag.
        Actually, scratch that — I'm under a flag I made for myself.<br>
<br>
And this isn't about politics. It's about my perspective. Presidents fighting? That's on them. Has nothing to do with regular people.<br>
<br>
We're all the same. There are no bad people — everyone's beautiful in their own way. I know that. But yeah, unfortunately, I also know the dark side of people. And still... I'm just indifferent to everyone.<br>
<br>
But if you ask for help — I'll help. Not because I'm nice. But 'cause sometimes people help me too.<br>
<br>
I enjoy life. I smile. Not because I'm kind. But because I know I can't be dragged into propaganda. It's everywhere — in every country. Gotta accept that.<br>
<br>
How do I put it simply?<br>
Yeah... I'm all about staying neutral."<br></p>
